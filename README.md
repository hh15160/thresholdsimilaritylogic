# Threshold Similarity Logic

Threshold Similarity Logic is a new framework for similarity logic. A `similarity expression` is defined, along with its belief value; interpreted as the probability that two elements in a metric space have a distance less than an uncertain threshold. The belief values can be used to calculate the belief in a sentence of similarity expressions, in propositional logic. This code contains the implementation of this framework in Python with the algorithms that emerge within this framework under different dependence assumptions between thresholds; complete dependence, complete independence, and a varying dependence - modelled by Frankâ€™s Copula.

## Getting Started

This folder can be cloned to a local machine and the files run in a terminal. 

## Running the tests

There are three different files containing Python Simulations for different dependence assumptions between thresholds; complete dependence, complete independence, and a varying dependence. The files should run in a terminal without any changes. The length of the formula (k) and the number of similarity expressions (n) generated can be edited in the main loops towards the bottom of the files.
